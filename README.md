 This simple python script generates infinite openrouter api keys ðŸ”¥
 
> [!NOTE]
> ~~Openrouter has added turnstiles and im to lazy to fix this as I already have hundreds of api keys, so if you want make a pr and Ill merge it.~~>
> I updated it, well Copilot did (fully made with copilot for the most part while I was playing R6, vibe coding may be the future I'm not sure.)
